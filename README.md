# Rose of Dune
Inspired by the gentle glow of desert dunes at dusk, where rose-gold light meets earthy brown shadows.
White and rose-toned surfaces evoke calm and elegance, while the brown whisper adds depth and grounded warmth.
Designed for those who want a subtle, refined workspace — graceful, inviting and quietly radiant.
